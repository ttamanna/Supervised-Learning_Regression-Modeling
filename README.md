# Supervised-Learning_Regression-Modeling
An annotated data having input-output pair is processed by training with a machine learning model. The trained model then can be used to make predictions on unsee data (or test set). 

The following tasks are focused:
* Ordinary linear regression model on one-dimensional feature/variable
* Ordinary linear regression model on multi-dimensional features/variables
* Ridge regression and hyper-parameter tuning
